# Gulf Stream
### Project Description
In this project I will aim to understand the effects of the Earth's rotation on the ocean. Specifically, I will analyze the Gulf Stream and the impacts of the Earth's rotation on heat, salinity, and sea surface height.

In an attempt to investigate this, I plan to construct a model of the Gulf Stream, on the east coast of North America. This model will be for one year ran under two different conditions. One with Earth's normal rotation, and another with angular velocity increased to be twice as fast. The start of the model will be simulated on January 2008. After running the model, I will be able to see how these variables are effected.
